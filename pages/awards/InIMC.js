                InIMC might be the most
                memorable competition Iâ€™ve
                ever had. Team contest consists
                10 problems to discuss with our
                team. On the other hand, Team contest calculated by
                summing of the highest three
                individual contest from four
                participant in a team (3 silvers)
                and compete with 6 other
                teams. Group contest, also
                known as grand prize, means
                accumulative from all
                individual scores and team
                contest scores. Our team
                achieve 633 scores in total,
                while the champion, Singapore
                A team, achieved 687.
